🎥 Smart Movie AI Project

Welcome to the Smart Movie AI Project, a dynamic movie recommendation system that uses machine learning to generate smart tags for movies and integrates with the TMDB API to display movie details and posters. This project demonstrates how feature engineering and API integration can create a practical, interactive solution for movie recommendations.

📊 Project Overview

The core idea of this project is to improve movie recommendations by creating a "tags" feature. Instead of relying on a single attribute like genres, this project combines multiple features such as genres, cast, crew, and keywords into a consolidated tags column. These tags help the model better understand each movie's core themes and make more accurate recommendations.

After generating the tags, I integrated the TMDB API to fetch details and posters for the top 5 recommended movies, making the output visually appealing and user-friendly.
